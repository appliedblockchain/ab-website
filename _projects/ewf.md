title: Energy Web Foundation
subtitle: Node hosting for an energy blockchain
industry: Energy
deliverables: Node hosting

summary: The Energy Web Foundation (EWF) is a global non-profit organization focused on accelerating blockchain technology across the energy sector. Applied Blockchain is an EWF affiliate.

challenge: 
    <p class="body--large body--bold">As an EWF affiliate member, Applied Blockchain was invited to run an authority node in the Energy Web Chain blockchain network.</p>
    <p>A blockchain networkâ€™s security is enhanced via decentralisation, but finding parties with the capacity and desire to run a node is challenging. If the blockchain sits with one or a small number of parties it is easier to undermine than if it is hosted by many independent parties. The EWF Web Chain uses the PoA (Proof of Authority) consensus mechanism which relies on authorities to secure the network, if more than 50% of the authorities were to collude they could undermine the network. Running a reliable PoA node in the network, and providing further assurance through independent monitoring, alerting and reporting, requires blockchain expertise and experience.</p>

outcome: 
    The EWF approached Applied Blockchain to run an authority node in their Energy Web Chain blockchain network. Applied Blockchain provisioned infrastructure and ran an Ethereum Parity node which met the requirements and configuration of the Energy Web Chain network.
    The Applied Blockchain Block Explorer was deployed on top of the node to enable exploration of the blockchain and monitoring of forks/ReOrgs.
