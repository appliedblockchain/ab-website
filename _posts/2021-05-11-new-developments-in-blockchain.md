headline: Crypto Winter or the Winter of Crypto?
---

In 2019 we endured crypto winter. It was a dark period for blockchain in general.Crypto winter followed a period of excessive excitement in both the enterprise world, where a large number of proof of concepts were undertaken, and crypto, where a large number of projects were funded through token issuance.

In 2021 we've seen something quite different to crypto winter, perhaps "the winter of crypto" is a more apt description.
I'm not sure whether it was Elon Musk's tweets that set the crypto market alight, or the enterprise adoption of crypto by a range of corporates including Musk's Tesla, or the background work in DeFi, CDBC, and NFT's that endured during crypto winter hibernation and began bearing fruit, or perhaps a combination of all of the above.

# Blockchain energy consumption and the environment:

One of the questions we get asked the most is **“what about blockchain energy consumption and the environment?”**

We see a lot of misinformation about blockchain. Even the FT got it slightly wrong this weekend. The article states “the higher the price, the more demand for mining to be released into circulation, the more coins are mined, the more complex proof of work algorithm” I think that this is slightly incorrect. Supply (rate of production) of Bitcoins doesn’t change with demand. Only price changes as demand goes up. Supply is constant based on a fixed amount for each block over time. So the “more coins are mined” conclusion is wrong, but a higher value of Bitcoin does increase the incentive for more parties to try to mine to win the Bitcoins. In any case, proof of work mining does consume a vast amount of energy with no purpose other than to secure the network.However, this high energy consumption only applies to proof of work network, primarily Bitcoin.

Ethereum has been migrating from proof of work to proof stake, which relies on staking coins rather than energy consuming mining in order to secure the network. This means that a proof of stake Ethereum network will not consume energy beyond standard computation required for a secure distributed database. This is also true for most other modern blockchains.
