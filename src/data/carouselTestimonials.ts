All the project management side of this was taken care of by them and they were very professional at every stage. They gave us a clear roadmap and vision as to how to deliver this change, ensuring the project ran extremely smoothly. This freed up a lot of time on our side for us to focus on the quality and product side of things, and it was easy working with them to adapt the project around the feedback we received from our users.',

It was really important for us to make sure that all of the stakeholders involved in the project understood the requirements, particularly understood the needs of our customers. One of the things we found was that the Applied Blockchain team was able to firstly understand those immediate needs and challenges of our customers and were also able to help us understand the wider potential for the technology in the context of the wider environment.',

      'From a blockchain perspective, Applied Blockchain really understands the business and really understands the technology. In fact I wouldn’t have decided to work with Adi on the project had it had he not had the expertise or I had I not had the comfort level around his expertise in blockchain technology. Being in the blockchain business, I think I’ve seen a lot of consultancies come up. Some of them have very good expertise but they are unable to see it from an enterprise level. They understand how to build a solution or build a proof-of-concept but when they think about it within the context of the greater technology built within a major corporation, I don’t think that other companies quite understand that or have that expertise. I would recommend Applied Blockchain to any customer. It’s not just about the technology, it’s not just how the blockchain technology can be applied within a larger corporation but it’s some of the unique features that they understand, some of the unique challenges that surround blockchain technology such as privacy, such as security, such as various other elements that they’ve solved and various other companies haven’t.',
