<p class="post__content">Eight of the brightest international scale-ups disrupting the cyber security industry have been identified to undertake the 10-week programme, helping them to raise their profiles, identify commercial opportunities and prepare for growth. The programme, taking place in London, will introduce the companies to potential customers, decision makers, and thought leaders in their field who could advise, mentor, or partner with their business.</p>
<p class="post__content">Participants in the programme will undertake a business development curriculum and receive advice from entrepreneurs and experts on topics such as leadership, operational growth, investor readiness, sales and marketing, as well as how boards view and strategise around cyber security.</p>
<p class="post__content">The programme will culminate in an Executive Evening, the programme’s corporate pitching event, where the cohort will present to PwC and CyLon’s network of senior executives, industry thought leaders and decision makers.</p>
<p class="post__content">Since launching in 2017, PwC’s Scale programmes have supported over 240 scale-ups to grow through various sector/regional focused groups. These programmes presented opportunities for scale-ups to connect with over 2000 corporate executives to enable over 3000 introductions.</p>
<p class="post__content">Richard Horne, cyber security partner at PwC, said:</p>
<p class="post__quote">“Cyber security risk continues to rank highly amongst CEOs’ top threats to their organisation. We need innovative new businesses like our cohort to help tackle the latest cyber threats and build a more secure digital society.</p>
<p class="post__quote">“This programme will support these high growth scale-ups on their journey and help generate mutually beneficial commercial opportunities and relationships with established organisations.”</p>
