## Introduction

### Getting started
* Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
```
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll new my-site
cd my-site
```
* Run the website in development mode
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
> Local URL: [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

> Staging URL: [next.appliedblockchain.com](https://next.appliedblockchain.com/)

### Dependencies & Methodologies

#### SASS & Compass
Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
> You need Ruby and npm to run SASS and Compass
* [Install Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)
* [Install Compass](http://compass-style.org/install/)


#### BEM Markdown
Along with SASS, this project is based on the BEM markdown. To learn more about BEM:
* [bem.info](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/)
* [getbem.com](http://getbem.com/introduction/)

<p>&nbsp;</p>

***
## Deployment

The deployment process is run throught CircleCI.

When the **develop** branch is merged with **master**, it automatically prompts a workflow in CircleCI that builds the website and deploys it to the [staging URL](https://next.appliedblockchain.com/).
Once you have tested the changes (on both mobile and desktop, and on all browsers, including IE11), click the `confirm_deploy` button in the workflow, and the deployment will start.

> Even small text changes can have a graphical impact on the look of the website. Carefully check any changes you make on the content.

### Test
Use [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/users/sign_in) to test the website on different devices and browsers.
> The website is fully fonctionnal on Internet Explorer 11 and above

<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Page structure
Every page is build on the same structure:
* They are divided in [sections](#section-system), representing each part of the page
* The page and section headers are [components](#components), ensuring that they will have the same structure throughout the whole website
* Horizontally, elements are sometimes distributed using a bootstrap like [column system](#column-system)
```html
{% include containers/site/header.html %}

<div class="page" id="ID_OF_PAGE">

    {% include components/page-header.html
        HERE YOU CAN ADD THE VARIABLES
    %}

    <section class="section">

        {% include containers/sections/header.html
            HERE YOU CAN ADD THE VARIABLES
        %}

        <div class="section__content">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col--4"></div>
                <div class="col--8"></div>
            </div>
        </div>

    </section>
    <!-- repeat section if needed -->

</div>

{% include containers/site/footer.html %}
```

### Section system

#### Section types
Add these classes to customise them:

| Class                   | Description |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `section--col`          | divide by two the left and right padding of the section |
| `section--alt`          | Remove the top padding of a section; used when too sisters section have the same background color |
| `section--fullwidth`    | Fullwidth section |
| `section--nopadding`    | Remove all paddings (e.g. **grid section** of the [Projects](https://appliedblockchain.com/case-studies/) page) |
| `section--margin-minus` | Add a negative margin top to the section to make them overlap (e.g. **why us section** of the [Homepage](https://appliedblockchain.com/)) |

#### Section colors
Change the background color of a section (default is white) using `.section--primary`, `.section--dark` or `.section--grey`.

#### Section alignement
Left or rifght align the text and content of a section (default is centered aligned) using `.section--left` or `.section--right`.

### Components
The components are located in the `_data` folder. They were created to ensure that every iteration has the same structure, and that it will be easy to edit it. Each of them has a set of attributes.
> if you want one attribute not to appear, simply delete the line

#### Page header
```
{% include components/page-header.html
    background-color=''
    title='Page Title'
    description='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.'
    comment=''
%}
```
The page header is used once on a page, at the very beginning.

##### Background imnage in page header
* Add image in `resources/images/background` folder
* Same name as page, jpg format
* Add `background-image=''` to component
* Set `background-color=''` for gradient color

#### Section header
```
{% include containers/sections/header.html
    comment='Lorem ipsum'
    title='Section title'
    subtitle='Section subitle'
    description='Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.'
%}
```

### Column system
If needed, elements can be layed out horizontally using a [bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_grid_system.asp) like column system. It as based on a 12 column structure. You can add prefixes to the number to set up the responsive behaviour of each column.
```html
<div class="row">
    <div class="col--lg3 col--md4"></div>
    <div class="col--lg7 col--md8"></div>
    <div class="col--lg2 col--md12"></div>
</div>
```
> See the `resources/sass/partials/_structure.scss` for reference

```yml
    role: 
      'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
      <br><br>Consectetur adipiscing elit.
      <br><br>Curabitur ultricies vitae odio sit amet rhoncus.'
```

```yml
    responsabilities:
        '<li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</li>

<!-- ## General queries

### Logo and menu icon color on landing
If the `page-header.html` of a page is set to `background='primary'` or `background='dark'`, the logo and menu icon colors change.
To do so, go to `_layouts/header.html` and add the page title to the condition in the class selector.
```html
<div class="header__bar">
    <div class="header__logo {% if page.title == 'Name of the page'  or page.title == 'Name of other page' %}alt{% endif %}">
        {% include components/logo-header.html %}
    </div>
    <a class="header__button button button--menu {% if page.title == 'Name of the page'  or page.title == 'Name of other page' %}alt{% endif %}">
        <span class="button__inner"></span>
    </a>
</div>
```
* If set to `background='primary'`, both the **logo and menu icon** change.
* If set to `background='dark'`, only the **menu icon** changes.

* An image diesn't appear
    * Check file extension

### Logo carousels
* image size, difference between regular and alt version -->
