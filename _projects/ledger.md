challenge:
    - paragraph: Ethereum EIP1559 is a change to the Ethereum protocols that allows the user to pay a high gas fee in order for their transaction to be prioritised (or a lower one, for lower priority and longer processing time). Ledger commissioned Applied Blockchain to add support for Ethereum’s EIP1559 in the Ledger live app. With this integration, both the Ledger Live Desktop and Ledger Live Mobile apps allow users to utilise EIP1559 transactions on  Ethereum.

delivery:
    - item:
      - paragraph: Applied Blockchain designed and developed this integration in collaboration with the Ledger Live app product team. The changes were implemented in the transaction generation and signing logic.

results:
    - paragraph: EIP1559 replaces the first-price auction as the main gas fee calculation and embeds an average price for Ethereum transactions. As Ethereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the Ledger Live app, this feature was highly anticipated by the platform’s users.

testimonial:
  - quote: The Applied Blockchain team has been super kind and super helpful, allowing to go back and forth, allowing us to change and to adapt to our user feedbacks and always taking into consideration what the changes were and it’s been really really helpful on outside. I’d say it’s been super easy because also all the project management side of this were taken care of. That means the roadmap was very clear, the vision was very clear and it ensured basically that everything went realy smooth and it freed a lot of time actually on our side to just focus on quality and focus on the product side things when you have a great team working on your future.
