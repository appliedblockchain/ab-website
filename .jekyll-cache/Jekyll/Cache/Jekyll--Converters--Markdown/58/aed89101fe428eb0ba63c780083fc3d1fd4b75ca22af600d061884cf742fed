<p>‚ÄúThe opening of our new office in Porto and having an on-the-ground presence in continental Europe is the next natural step in the development of Applied Blockchain, and indicative of our ambition for, and commitment to, growth. It is also reflective of the increased demand we have seen for our expertise in the distributed ledger market, as we continue to deliver high-quality application solutions and products across a variety of sectors,‚Äù said Adi Ben-Ari, Founder &amp; CEO at Applied Blockchain.</p>

<p>‚ÄúAlthough Portugal is a relatively new face in the global technology landscape, it has quickly risen as one of the world‚Äôs leading hubs for nurturing a high-quality pool of business and technology graduates. As a result, its developer community is blossoming,‚Äù said Adi Ben-Ari.</p>

<p>Applied Blockchain has already recruited for its new development centre and continues to expand its talent pool. The Porto office is well positioned to access top talent across technology and different business areas.</p>

<p>‚ÄúWe are very excited to be part of the dynamic and exciting tech community that is developing in Portugal. We believe Portugal offers Applied Blockchain the best opportunity to develop our business and tap into a world-leading group of skilled and ambitious talent who can match our own business and quality aspirations.‚Äù</p>
