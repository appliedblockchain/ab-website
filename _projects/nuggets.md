    Nuggets is an agnostic tool, applicable anywhere. It only uses biometric identification, so there are no passwords to remember – or to risk being stolen. And the product doesn’t track users, the way other ‘single sign-in’ services do. In providing this simple, trusted tool for consumers, Nuggets also solves corporates biggest problem: data security and cybercrime. If companies no longer need to store millions of customers’ data, they can’t be hacked.
