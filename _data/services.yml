    title: Production-Ready
    body: We understand the difference between writing smart contracts for POCs in a lab environment and architecting and deploying a distributed blockchain application into a production environment. When we design all our applications, we keep in mind the end state of very different production environments of both enterprises and startups to ensure we are production-ready at delivery.

    title: Private & secure
    body: Blockchain technology is implemented to create a trustless network and to significantly reduce fraud.
