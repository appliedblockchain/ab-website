  answer: Through building several real world, solutions for startup clients, our team has the hands on experience in using the technology and building full end-to-end solutions for a number of use cases across a number of sectors. Simultaneously working with enterprise clients means we also build in corporates requirements for components such as security, privacy and interoperability, hardening our technology stack and factoring scale in from the architectural design stage. For our startup clients, we sometimes also offer partnership opportunities with a range of benefits for early stage companies.

  answer: Our team operate with an agile methodology and build solutions with quick turnaround, usually completing a proof of concept or minimum viable product solution within 6-12 weeks.
