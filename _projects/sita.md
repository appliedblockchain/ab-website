  title: "Applied Blockchain has been commissioned by SITA, the world’s leading specialist in air transport communications and information technology for the aviation industry with a turnover of $1.6 Billion and 4,500 employees, to develop the world’s first distributed drone registry. The private blockchain platform brings together drone operators, drone manufacturers and regulators together with a single source of truth."

    Flight path data captured by a drone during a flight can be uploaded onto the same shared ledger and represented visually on an interactive map. As this data is attached to a registered drone, aviation authorities can plot the flights of a specific drone, all drones of a given operator, or even all drones from a specific manufacturer, all on a single map and in real time. This access to data is a paradigm shift from legacy-based systems, which inherently rely upon a single trusted party to maintain the data and provide the correct level of access to users.

testimonial:
  - quote: "Applied Blockchain have always been very helpful by coming up with new concepts and new developments. They challenge you as a customer, they say “have you thought about this, have you thought about that?”. This has been very refreshing and I would definitely recommend Applied Blockchain."
