headline: A recent report from Forbes (2021) shows that Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) transaction volume more than quadrupled in 2020, from $62 million to over $250 million. Brands like NBA, Nike, and Formula 1 have started to issue their own NFTs, catering to a tech-savvy audience.

NBA Top Shots, the first blockchain licensing agreement entered by the NBA has already generated almost over $230m this year alone.

Many other companies are exploiting the opportunity offered by NFTs. For instance, on Friday, 5th of March 2021, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, launched the sale of the first Tweet posted on the social platform as a NFT (BBC, 2021). Meanwhile, the world of NFTs has already caught the attention of artists such as Beeple, whose works were recently sold by the prestigious auction house Christie's.

Prior to the blockchain technology revolution, the cost of replicating something in the digital world was almost zero. Think of the copy and paste mechanism that damages the rights of economic use of photos or other works of art on the internet. Since the introduction of blockchain technology, this can be solved. These goods, even of an artistic nature, become digitally rare because they are not fungible. Thus, it is possible to distinguish a photo or a copied work.

Non-fungible tokens (NFT) are tradable universal blockchain-based ownership records for specific items. Unlike currencies such as Bitcoin, and fungible tokens such as utility tokens, NFTs are not interchangeable with each other.

NFTs represent a peculiar type of cryptographic token that is defined:

- Using a standard; for example [Ethereum ERC-721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721), or
- Natively in the general purpose blockchain platform (e.g. [Algorand](https://developer.algorand.org/search/?search_query=nft&category=all-categories)), or
- Natively in a dedicated NFT blockchain platform (e.g. [Flow](https://docs.onflow.org/)).

An NFT represents something unique. Since these tokens are not fungible, they are not mutually interchangeable.

# The main characteristics of NFT are the following:

Uniqueness: NFTs contain metadata where information of various kinds can be entered. It is a highly important feature, particularly when the resource they represent is digital. Since digital files can be copied endlessly and perfectly, thanks to NFTs, the uniqueness and originality of the source document can be demonstrated.

**Rarity**: the value of NFTs comes from their scarcity. The developers of these Tokens often limit their distribution to increase rarity.

**Authenticity**: Blockchain technology allows you to certify the authenticity of the Token.

**Indivisibility**: It is not possible to divide a token into divisible parts. NFTs cannot be broken down into smaller denominations - they can only be bought, sold and stored in their entirety.

**Ownership**: it is possible to uniquely identify the owner of a specific Token.

**Verifiability**: Being connected to a blockchain, the storage of historical ownership, items can be traced back to the original creator, allowing pieces to be authenticated without the need for third-party verification.

As NFTs are located in the universe of the blockchain, it is interesting to underline that their use allows to demonstrate and certify the intellectual property of the object in question: regardless of the transfer of ownership of the latter, its attribution will always remain in the hands of the creator. The certainty provided by the blockchain also makes them proof of authenticity.

# NFT use cases

Having reviewed these characteristics, it can be stated that the potential applications of this technology are numerous: modernizing the collecting market, eliminating fraud in the entertainment industry, allowing someone to prove ownership or other rights in real or digital assets are just other examples.

## Art

The space in which art and consequently the blockchain applied to it must confront each other are property, corporeality, manipulation, and value.
The ability to combine the identity of the work with the creative path of the same and to bring this history to the blockchain, allows each creative action and passage of the work to generate an NFT, which connected and chained to the previous one can maintain information and generate a story.

The safety of the work is not entrusted to third parties, but to the historical path of the individual actions, the complete representation of the work is the sum of all the actions recorded on the non-modifiable NFT tokens. The possibility offered by a structure that "tells" the entire story of the work with non-manipulable NFTs, formed by a chain in which it is not possible to alter its sequence, gives the artist the entire path to create it and the unique identity of the work.

## Collectibles

Works of art, real estate, stamps, and rare collectibles are just some examples of real objects that are digitized with NFTs. In practice, these NFTs can represent fractions of physical assets that can be stored and exchanged as tokens on a blockchain.

## Supply Chain

NFT’s can be used to represent physical components and products flowing through a supply chain. This enables provenance checks to be made on a per-item basis. NFTs can be particularly useful also for keeping track of physical assets, such as luxury items, rare artifacts, and products in a supply chain. Two of the main benefits of tokenizing these assets are quality control and the reduction of counterfeiting, as anyone can verify the origin of goods by querying the blockchain.

There are three main levels where NFTs can significantly affect the supply chain:

- **Organisations**: NFTs can be used to identify organisations and their credentials (e.g. anti-slavery, ISO certification)
- **Paperwork**: The traditional supply chain system records all the property titles and registration, contracts, purchase orders, invoices and payments  through cumbersome paperwork. Blockchain can digitize and connect the entire process, and some documents could be securitised (e.g. invoices) using NFT’s.
- **Products and components** in a supply chain should be represented as an NFT. NFTs can be used to track materials as they move through the supply chain, and they can represent the provenance, the quality assurance, and sustainability properties of products.

We will continue to see further improvements in the infrastructure behind NFTs. Applied Blockchain positions itself as one of the technologies developed above the blockchain ecosystem. At Applied Blockchain, we began studying the NFT market intensely, helping clients to understand NFTs for particular markets, as well as giving them an impartial view of the technology platforms and suitability for a particular market and use case.

The possibility of certifying both physical and digital objects allows speculation on intensive use to come with potentially any area that could be affected. Major players are rapidly moving in this direction, seizing the opportunity to capitalize on a broader shift towards virtual reality.

Applied Blockchain can help to build NFT based solutions and support, scaling and growing an NFT marketplace, and building an infrastructure of dedicated services and products guaranteed by NFT.

One of the most frequent debates is centered on the idea that there are many parallels between crypto and NFT. Crypto is very speculative, and so is NFT. Whether you want to use it or not, crypto has facilitated the further development and maturing of blockchain technology, and NFT will do the same.

Developments in public blockchains involving cryptocurrencies, including Decentralised Exchanges and Decentralized Finance (DeFi), are creating tremendously efficient alternative financial services infrastructure. NFTs are starting to do the same for collectibles. Whether you attach any value to the speculative activity or not, you cannot ignore the maturing and growing mainstream adoption of the technology.
