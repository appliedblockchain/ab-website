<p class="post__headline">Travel Ledger Alliance has announced that it has selected Applied Blockchain as its development partner to build and deliver the base architecture and minimum viable product for Travel Ledger, a distributed billing and settlement platform for the travel industry.</p>

<p class="post__content">Based in Canary Wharf, Applied Blockchain has an expert team of in-house blockchain developers that have been building solutions for the past two years. The team has built blockchain applications that are now live in production environments, being used by real customers.</p>
<p class="post__content">During the initial analysis stage of the project the Travel Ledger team built a platform “prototype” to validate the technology and learn which areas to focus on during the upcoming development phase.</p>
<p class="post__content">“It was very valuable to evolve our thinking through working with a prototype and a real platform we could interact with. Now we have a much clearer idea of requirements and can quickly proceed to the next phase, which is to build a minimum viable product.” said Roberto Da Re.</p>
<p class="post__content">Applied Blockchain will design the platform and carry out the development from the ground up leveraging their own development tools and experience gained in their previous projects building solution on the Ethereum platform.</p>
<p class="post__content">“Blockchain development is a new and very specific area of expertise and while our Alliance partners provide access to great skills in the travel technology space, working with an organisation that can provide us the best available knowledge and experience in the blockchain space is vital to ensure the success and scalability of the project from the outset.”</p>
<p class="post__content">Applied Blockchain was also specifically selected for their expertise in the financial sector, including business-to- business integration and payments.</p>
<p class="post__content">“For Travel Ledger this means that they not only understand the concepts of business-to- business billing and settlement, but also the fundamental requirements relating to confidentiality and security,” explained Roberto Da Re.</p>
<p class="post__content">The plan is to deliver a minimum viable product on a “test net” by early July so that travel technology companies will be able to start testing the API and integrating with Travel Ledger in readiness for commencing the pilot phase of the platform, planned for the autumn.</p>
<p class="post__content">Roberto Da Re, Founder of Travel Ledger Alliance said, “We are looking forward to working with Applied Blockchain; we felt we are like-minded in wanting to deliver a robust and practical solution, while understanding the requirements of an enterprise solution that over time will have to run mission critical applications for a very large number of companies.”</p>
<p class="post__content">Adi Ben-Ari, Founder & CEO of Applied Blockchain added, “We are very excited about working with Roberto and the Travel Ledger Alliance to develop Travel Ledger. We share the belief that blockchain technology can revolutionise business processes and bring about greater efficiencies in transaction and settlement, and look forward to bringing these benefits to the travel industry.”</p>
