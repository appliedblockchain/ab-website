    '<div class="col--xl4 col--lg6 col--md8">
        Today, consumers share and store personal, payment and password data with 50+ different online services. If any one of these services is breached, they all become vulnerable. With Nuggets, blockchain technology means users never share their data with anyone – not even Nuggets itself.
    </div>
    <div class="col--xl4 col--lg6 col--md8">
        Nuggets is an agnostic tool, applicable anywhere. It only uses biometric identification, so there are no passwords to remember – or to risk being stolen. And the product doesn’t track users, the way other ‘single sign-in’ services do. In providing this simple, trusted tool for consumers, Nuggets also solves corporates biggest problem: data security and cybercrime. If companies no longer need to store millions of customers’ data, they can’t be hacked.
