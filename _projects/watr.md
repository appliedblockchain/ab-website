challenge:
     - paragraph: 'Watr is building an open and connected commodities ecosystem for entrepreneurs, investors, developers, and traditional market participants. The ecosystem is created on top of a public, layer 1 Polkadot parachain (blockchain) also referred to as the Watr Protocol. Commodities forward contracts will be created as NFT’s (non-fungible tokens) so that each commodity forward contract can be differentiated and unique based on its attributes. Watr commissioned Applied Blockchain to design and develop an MVP for the Watr Marketplace from the ground up.'
