subtitle: Increase security and transparency of your private, consortium or side network with an Applied Blockchain secured node
body: Private, consortium and side networks are often controlled by a small group of entities that may collude to undermine the blockchain consensus and thereby defraud network users. Applied Blockchain will host and control an independent node in your network, and monitor, alert and report in the case of forks, reordering of transactions or any malicious behaviour that may undermine the security of your blockchain network.
