body: Confidential Computing technology presents a new set of opportunities.</br>The technology enables computation to be conducted on data without the party running the computation having any access to the data.</br>The data resides in a hardware secure enclave, meaning that even a system administrator or someone with physical access to the device with melicious intent is not able to access the data.</br>We specialise in building solutions using R3 Conclave, Microsoft Azure, and Intel SGX technologies.</br>
