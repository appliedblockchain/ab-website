summary: Chainlink is a decentralised network of oracles that enables smart contracts to interact securely with real-world data and services outside blockchain networks. With Chainlink, the traditional systems that currently power modern economies can connect to the emerging blockchain industry to generate more security, efficiency, and transparency in business and social processes.

challenge:
    - paragraph: One of the primary purposes of the Chainlink Community Grant Program is to support the developers' community by making it easy to learn about, build, and impact the world with hybrid smart contracts and Chainlink oracles. Applied Blockchain was therefore commissioned with the grant to build native Chainlink support within the Create Eth App developer toolkit. Create Eth App is a community resource for quickly and securely developing full-stack, Ethereum-powered React applications with key smart contract tooling and APIs already built-in. Create Eth App saves developers substantial time and resources when building Web3 applications by giving them standardised and thoroughly tested one-click templates for deploying code.

challenge-video: false

delivery:
    - item:
      - paragraph: Applied Blockchain built language templates and ABIs that developers need to launch Web3 interfaces for Chainlinked smart contracts via the Create Eth App. They provide developers with a mature foundation for building a web experience that consumes and presents data from Chainlink. Applied Blockchain will conduct ongoing tests and update the Create Eth App library for Chainlink to remain secure, functional, and easy to use.

results:
    - paragraph: By adding functionality for Chainlink within Create Eth App, developers can seamlessly create an intuitive interface for Chainlinked applications on Ethereum with just a single command. For example, a Web3-enabled interface can be launched with a built-in connection to Chainlink Price Feeds through a my-eth-app template—speeding up development time without sacrificing security.
