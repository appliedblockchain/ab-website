        Applied Blockchain is working with BABB, a financial institution that is applying to become a social bank, to build the core banking infrastructure and a full-stack banking application on a private blockchain using smart contracts. The solution stores customer data within smart contracts on the blockchain and connects customers and banking service providers on a shared network, where the permissions for who can access or use that data is entirely controlled directly by the customer.

        BABB is a multi-sided platform built to provide banking and other financial services to individuals and small businesses. It is a unique opportunity to bring financial inclusion and social cohesion to the widest possible audience, connecting the Beneficiary and the Sender without resorting to unnecessary middlemen or middle-layers of technologies.
