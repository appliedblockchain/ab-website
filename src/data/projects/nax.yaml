    title: The Background
    content:
      - Ledger has a range of the most popular hardware wallets in the industry, with over 2M users in 165 countries. These store a user`s private key enabling them to hold cryptocurrency and sign transactions securely.
      - Ledger provides two different models, the Nano S Plus and Nano X, the latter connecting through Bluetooth, and both of these support over 5,500 digital assets. The hardware wallets come equipped with the Ledger Live app, that allows users to buy, sell, own, and invest their crypto assets.

    title: The Challenge
    content:
      - Ethereum EIP1559 is a change to the Ethereum protocols that allows the user to pay a high gas fee in order for their transaction to be prioritised (or a lower one, for lower priority and longer processing time).
      - Ledger commissioned Applied Blockchain to add support for Ethereum`s EIP1559 in the Ledger live app. With this integration, both the Ledger Live Desktop and Ledger Live Mobile apps allow users to utilise EIP1559 transactions on Ethereum.

    title: The Outcome
    content:
      - EIP1559 replaces the first-price auction as the main gas fee calculation and embeds an average price for Ethereum transactions. As Ethereum is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the Ledger Live app, this feature was highly anticipated by the platform`s users.
