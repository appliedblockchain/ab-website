title: Watr
subtitle: Digital Commons for Commodities
industry: Blockchain
short_summary: Watr is the digital home for a new class of (physical) commodity flows: tokenised and programmable. It connects these flows and the industry pioneers behind them with a vibrant community of global developers, entrepreneurs and investors. Watr Protocol is Watr’s decentralised and public blockchain platform open to everyone who wants to build, create and collaborate. It is a Polkadot parachain, leveraging the shared security of the Polkadot ecosystem, high transaction throughput, connectivity with the other parachains and regular upgrades. Its focus is commodities.

summary: 'Applied Blockchain has been working closely with the Algorand Foundation since 2019, including developing a range of leading Algorand decentralised applications from <a class="giveaway--link" target="_blank" href="https://appliedblockchain.com/projects/opulous">Opulous</a> music rights financing, to <a class="giveaway--link" target="_blank" href="https://appliedblockchain.com/projects/aorist">Aorist<a/> high-end digital art marketplace, and core infrastructure such as <a class="giveaway--link" target="_blank" href="https://londonbridge.io">London Bridge</a>, a secure token bridge between Ethereum and Algorand, and <a class="giveaway--link" target="_blank" href="https://silentdata.com">Silent Data</a>, a privacy-preserving data oracle.'

challenge:
     - paragraph: 'Watr is building an open and connected commodities ecosystem for entrepreneurs, investors, developers, and traditional market participants. The ecosystem is created on top of a public, layer 1 Polkadot parachain (blockchain) also referred to as the Watr Protocol. Commodities forward contracts will be created as NFT’s (non-fungible tokens) so that each commodity forward contract can be differentiated and unique based on its attributes.
Watr commissioned Applied Blockchain to design and develop an MVP for the Watr Marketplace from the ground up.'

         - paragraph: 'Applied Blockchain was selected by the Algorand Foundation to design, build, host and operate the very first independent Randomness Oracle for the Algorand blockchain. The cryptographic function implemented in the oracle is referred to as a <a class="giveaway--link" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function">Verifiable Random Function (VRF)</a>, and its authenticity is verified by Algorand smart contracts.'

results:
    - paragraph: 'The Algorand Randomness Oracle service developed, hosted and operated by Applied Blockchain was launched in mainnet on 17th November 2022, and is now the official source of randomness on the Algorand blockchain. It can be seen providing random numbers at regular intervals in the Algorand blockchain explorer <a class="giveaway--link" target="_blank" href="https://algoexplorer.io/address/APPLDMEYQTPYA25IGZLM5OBRWIGWYBJEPXRSKXKJTGEGYI2TJDC33SEZNU">here</a>, and these random values are available to be used by any smart contract deployed on the Algorand blockchain, including in games, generative NFTs, lotteries etc. A guide to using the Randomness Oracle can be found <a class="giveaway--link" target="_blank" href="https://developer.algorand.org/articles/usage-and-best-practices-for-randomness-beacon/">here</a>.'
