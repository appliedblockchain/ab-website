subtitle: "A key element of public distributed ledger technologies is that anyone hosting a node on the network can view all confirmed transactions on that network. This level of transparency naturally creates a barrier to entry for enterprises and startups who wish to deploy blockchain applications but require an element of privacy in order to maintain their competitive advantage."
